                    <p>
                        A data type is a classification of data. Programming languages need to have different datatypes to
                        interact properly with values. You can do math with a number, but not with a sentence, so the computer classifies
                        them differently. JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly
                        associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types. 
                        All types except objects define immutable values (values, which are incapable of being changed).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Strings:<br>
                            A string is a series of characters wrapped in quotes. Any data that contains text will be represented by a string.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Numbers:<br>
                            A number is a numerical value up to 15 digits. Numbers do not have any special syntax associated with them like strings do.
                            If you were to place a number in quotes ("13"), it wouldn’t be considered a number, but a character in a string.
                            A number can be whole or a decimal and can have a positive or negative value.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Boolean:<br>
                            A boolean is a value that is either true or false. Boolean values are very commonly used in programming for when a
                            value might switch between yes and no, on and off, or true and false. Booleans can represent the current state of
                            something that is likely to change.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Undefined:<br>
                            An undefined variable has no value. With the lt or var keyword, we’re declaring a variable, but until a value is
                            assigned to it, it is still undefined.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Null:<br>
                            Null is a value that represents nothing. Null is the intentional absence of any value. It represents something that
                            doesn’t exist and is not any of the other datatypes. The difference between null and undefined is rather subtle, but
                            the main distinction is that null is an intentionally empty value.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Objects:<br>
                            An object is a collection of key/value pairs. Any value that isn’t simply a string, number, Boolean, null, undefined,
                            or Symbol is an object. Objects consist of properties and methods. Properties are what the object is, and methods are
                            what the object does. 
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers.
                        You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a
                        variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the let, var, and const keywords.
                        A JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript
                        during variable declaration what type of value the variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change during
                        the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.

                        Imagine you have to write a program which performs a repetitive task such as counting from 1 to 100.
                        Coding 100 lines to do this task would be mundane. There has to be an easier way, right? This is where loops come into the picture.
                        Loops are specifically designed to perform repetitive tasks with one set of code. Loops save alot of time. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For Loops:<br>
                            There are three parts to a for loop. The variable declaration is the first part of the loop which initializes the variable at the
                            beginning of the loop to some value. This value is the starting point of the loop. The condition is the second part of the for loop
                            and it is the part that decides whether the loop will continue running or not. While the condition in the loop is true, it will
                            continue running. Once the condition becomes false, the loop will stop. The increment statementis the third part of the for loop.
                            It is the part of the loop that changes the value of the variable created in the variable declaration part of the loop. The increment
                            statement is the part of the for loop which will eventually stop the loop from running.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            While Loops:<br>
                            The while loop works differently than the for loop. The for loop repeats a segment of code a specific number of times, while the
                            while loop repeats a segment of code an unknown number of times. The code within a while loop will execute while the specified condition is true.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Do-while Loops:<br>
                            The do-while loop is very similar to the while loop, but it does things in reverse order. The mechanism of the while loop is - while a condition
                            is true, perform a certain action. The mechanism of the do-while loop is - perform a certain action while a condition is true. Furthermore, the code
                            within a do-while loop will always execute at least once, even if the specified condition is false. This is because the code is executed
                            before the condition is tested.

                            A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of
                        writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer
                        to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
                        There are a few different ways to define a function in JavaScript:
                    </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A Function Declaration defines a named function. To create a function declaration you use the function keyword followed
                                by the name of the function. When using function declarations, the function definition is hoisted, thus allowing the
                                function to be used before it is defined.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                A Function Expression defines a named or anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that has no name.
                                Function Expressions are not hoisted, and therefore cannot be used before they are defined.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                    <p>    
                        You may have heard the terms parameters and arguments used interchangeably. While very similar, there is an important
                        distinction to make between these two keywords. Parameters are used when defining a function, they are the names created in
                        the function definition. Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the
                        function is executed. Functions execute when the function is called. This process is known as invocation. You can invoke
                        a function by referencing the function name, followed by an open and closed parenthesis: ().Every function in JavaScript returns
                        undefined unless otherwise specified. We can customize what is returned in our function by using the return keyword
                        followed by our return value. The return statement not only returns values from a function, but it
                        assigns them to whatever called the function. Functions are function objects. In JavaScript, anything that is not a primitive
                        type ( undefined, null,boolean, number, or string) is an object. Objects in JavaScript are extremely versatile.
                        Because of this, we can even pass a function as a parameter into another function. When a function accepts another function as
                        a parameter, or returns a function, it is called a higher-order function.

                        To work with a chunk of digital data, we’ll first have to find a way to represent it in our machine’s memory. Say, for example,
                        that we want to represent a collection of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. We could get creative with strings—after all, strings can have
                        any length, so we can put a lot of data into them—and use "2 3 5 7 11" as our representation. But this is awkward. You’d have to somehow
                        extract the digits and convert them back to numbers to access them. Fortunately, JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing
                        sequences of values. It is called an array and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.
